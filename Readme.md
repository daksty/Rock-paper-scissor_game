This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where the player can play against the computer.

### Features

- Player vs. Computer: Play the classic rock-paper-scissors game against the computer.
- Random Opponent Choices: The computer opponent randomly selects its choices (rock, paper, or scissors) for each round.
- Score Tracking: Keep track of the player's score and the computer's score throughout the game.
- Visual Feedback: The GUI provides visual feedback by highlighting the player's and opponent's choices and displaying the result of each round.
- Reset after Each Round: The GUI elements are reset after each round, allowing the player to make a new choice.
